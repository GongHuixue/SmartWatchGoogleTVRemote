To build you need to check out the following projects:
https://code.google.com/p/googletv-android-samples
https://github.com/yolanother/EnhancedLivewareSdk.git

Once you have these projects downloaded you need to add them to Eclipse as library projects.

If you want to add new buttons to the watch remote you need to add a layout for the watch page in res/ and you need to update remote_page_layout.xml. See rp_playback_control.xml for an example.
